# Profile of Jenelle Spio-Garbrah

## Description
This project as intense as it is, serves to consolidate all that I have been learning in bootcamp. It contains example of how you can style WebPages by having a banner with a profile picture and text; include links with the navigation bar and main content. For a challenge, there are areas for improvement for example using flexbox and grid containers to position images on a page. Lastly, this project involved making a web page responsive by using media queries.
